This directory has my config files from manjaro install and customization on my laptop. It's basically a manjaro-xfce installation with awesome on top.

## Manjaro Awesome configuration

Based on https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats

The rc.lua is a modified updated version of the template with below changes
- Replace xlock with xflock4 ( a much better screenlocker that comes with xfce )
- Add rofi launcher
- Add autostart for dropbox, ibus-daemon, xrandr for 2-mon
- Replace xterm with urxvt
- Enable all layouts including the lain layouts.
- Map Modkey + Shift + w to XFCE Application finder for quickly launching all programs.

## URxvt configuration
The .Xresources has all the URxvt configuration.

## Rofi configuration
The .extend.Xresources has the rofi configuration.

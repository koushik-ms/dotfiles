# Notes

The .zshrc is a directly cusomized version of oh-my-zsh.zshrc with locally installed oh-my-zsh and locally installed custom theme for powerlevel9k (locally, meaning for current user in her home directory). This setup has been used in linux minut.

The oh-my-zsh.zshrc is a customized version from the AUR package. The .zshrc in this case is a boiler-plate generated from new user config and compinstall steps from first-run of zsh, which, in the end sources this file and the custom theme file. Both oh-my-zsh and custom theme in this case are installed from AUR (on manjaro).
